# TBA-Lite Changelog

## v0.9.96 — 2026-02-16

Initial release of TBA-Lite, a lightweight variant of the TBA modpack for players with lower-end machines. Connects to the same TBA server as the full modpack.

**149 mods** (down from 190 in full TBA)

### How It Works
- **tba-lite-stubs v0.1.0** — A ~90 KB stub mod that registers all 34 custom payload types and the StreamCraft display block, replacing StreamCraft, SynthCraft, SceneCraft, and CoreCurriculum
- Players on TBA-Lite can join the same server as full TBA players
- Custom mod features (video streaming, music generation, cinematic recording, build submissions) are unavailable but don't block gameplay
